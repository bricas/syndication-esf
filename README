Syndication::ESF - Create and update ESF files

This module is the basic framework for creating and maintaing Epistula Syndication
Format (ESF) files. More information on the format can be found at the Aquarionics
web site: http://www.aquarionics.com/article/name/esf

This module tries to copy the XML::RSS module's interface. All applicable methods
have been copied and should respond in the same manner.

Like in XML::RSS, channel data is accessed through the C<channel()> sub, and item
data is accessed straight out of the items array.
